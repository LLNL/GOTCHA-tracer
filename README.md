# GOTCHA Tracer

This is a simple example for how to create a tracer using [GOTCHA](https://github.com/llnl/GOTCHA).
It is also shows how a CMake project would integrate Gotcha.
This includes testing Gotcha via direct invocation and using `LD_PRELOAD`.

There are 3 steps to creating a tracer:

1. The function protypes for the functions to trace are added in a `modules/<module-name>.txt` file.
2. Through the functionality in `modules/translate.py`, the gotcha wrapers and wrapees for each module are generated.
3. All genetared modules are linked into the main trace library (see `src/`).
